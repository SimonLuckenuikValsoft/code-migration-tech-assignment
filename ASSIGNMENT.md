# Interview Technical Assignment

## Your Task: Migrate the Order Entry System to C# (.NET)

You have 90 minutes to migrate this Java Swing desktop application to a modern C# desktop application using WPF or .NET MAUI.

The migration may be partial. The goal is to understand your strategy, how you prioritize under constraints, and how you work.

## About the Legacy Application

This repository contains a Java Swing application for managing customer orders. The application includes:

### Core Features

- Customer Management: add, edit, and view customer records (name, email, phone, address)
- Product Catalog: view available products with pricing
- Order Processing: create and manage orders with multiple line items
- Automatic Calculations:
  - Subtotal
  - Tiered discounts
  - Tax
  - Grand total

## Migration Requirements

### Must Have (Core)

1. Migrate to a C# desktop application using WPF or .NET MAUI (complete or partial)
2. Implement Customer management:
    - View customers
    - Add a customer
    - Edit a customer
3. Implement Order management:
    - View orders
    - Create an order with line items
4. Preserve the discount and tax calculation logic

### Should Have

- Clean, maintainable structure
- Separation of concerns (UI, data access, business logic)
- Basic error handling and input validation

### Nice to Have

- UI/UX improvements over the original
- Any small enhancements you believe add value, with a short explanation of why

## What We Evaluate

1. Strategy & Approach: how you plan, prioritize, and sequence the migration
2. Working Code: a buildable, runnable application (partial completion is acceptable)
3. Code Quality: clean, readable, well-structured code
4. Decision Making: tradeoffs and assumptions, plus how you justify them
5. Use of Tools: effective and responsible use of AI and development tools

## Deliverables

1. Working C# application that builds and runs locally
2. README that includes:
   - Build and run instructions
   - What is complete and what is not complete
     - Assumptions and known issues
     - Your migration plan and what you prioritized
     - How you used AI tools, including how you validated results
3. Artifacts included in the repository, such as:
   - Prompts you used
   - Notes, plans, checklists, or diagrams
   - Any decisions or alternatives considered
4. Git history showing your workflow with meaningful commits
5. All code and documentation must be in English.

## Submission

When the 90 minutes have elapsed:

1. Push your final code to your private GitHub repository (main branch)
2. Ensure the README includes build and run instructions
3. Email simon.luckenuik@valsoftcorp.com with the repository link

Good luck !
